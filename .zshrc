# explaining the compinit -u hack:
  # the compinit -u hack is called for because I run the shell as a docker image
  # and mount the dotfiles repo as a volume. Compinit gets angry at me because
  # when docker mounts the volume, the permissions are wrong.
  # So when you run `exec zsh`, for exemple, compinit gets angry at you by saying:
  # "zsh compinit: insecure directories and files, run compaudit for list."
  # The -u flag tells compinit to be silent about that.
